# **Energy Optimization System and Renewable Energy Suggestion**

## **Project Overview**
The **Energy Optimization System and Renewable Energy Suggestion** is a web-based tool designed to help users monitor electricity usage, estimate monthly bills, and receive renewable energy suggestions based on their location. Users can enter appliance usage details, select electricity unit rates, and instantly see cost breakdowns and savings potential using solar or wind energy. The system also offers password-protected Excel export for secure tracking of historical data.

For complete details on project implementation, logic, and command instructions, refer to the **official project report**: [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LHsqbOMHoqr8DbADVo10adJstBjfJQhC/view?usp=sharing)

## **Features**
- Dynamic appliance input system with predefined and custom options  
- Automated bill estimation based on electricity unit rates  
- Renewable energy recommendations: wind energy for urban areas, solar energy for rural areas  
- Before and after cost comparison to highlight potential savings  
- Global data storage with password-protected Excel report generation  
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop users  

## **Technologies Used**
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- Excel Export: FileSaver.js, SheetJS (XLSX format)  
- UI Theme: Green-accented modern design  
- Global data handling for cumulative tracking

## **How It Works**
1. User selects location (Urban/Rural) and electricity cost per kWh  
2. Appliance usage data is entered for tracking consumption  
3. System computes total electricity usage and estimated bill  
4. Suggested renewable energy source is displayed along with installation cost  
5. Before and after cost comparison highlights savings potential  
6. Users can export all results via password-protected Excel file using password **0101**  

## **Setup and Installation**
To run the project locally:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiifza/Energy-Optimization-System-and-Renewable-energy
```
1. Navigate to the project directory  
2. Open `EOS.html` in a browser  
3. Enter appliance details, calculate bills, and explore renewable options  
4. Export electricity reports securely  

## **Future Enhancements**
- Real-time electricity cost API integration  
- Interactive consumption graphs using Chart.js  
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support for mobile users  

## **Contributions and Feedback**
Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or report issues to improve EOS further. Making energy tracking smarter and more efficient together.
